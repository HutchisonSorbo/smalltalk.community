# Superpowers Write Plan (Gate)

## Task

Plan for this task (exactly as provided by the user):
**{{input}}**

If `{{input}}` is empty or missing, ask the user to restate the task in one sentence and STOP.

## Rules

- DO NOT edit code.
- You may read files to understand context, but produce the plan and then stop.
- Plan steps must be small (2–10 minutes each) and include verification commands.

## Output format (use exactly)

## Goal

## Assumptions

## Plan

(Each step must include: Files, Change, Verify)

## Risks & mitigations

## Rollback plan

## Persist (mandatory)

Write the plan output to:

- `artifacts/superpowers/plan.md`

Create the folder if needed.
After writing, confirm it exists by listing `artifacts/superpowers/`.

## Approval

Ask:
**Approve this plan? Reply APPROVED if it looks good.**

If the user replies APPROVED:

- Do NOT implement yet.
- Reply: **"Plan approved. Run `/superpowers-execute-plan` to begin implementation."**

## Persist (mandatory)

After generating the plan content above, you MUST write it to `artifacts/superpowers/plan.md`.

If you cannot create the file directly, instruct the user to copy/paste the plan output into `artifacts/superpowers/plan.md`.

Do not implement changes in this workflow. Stop after persistence.
