Verification confirms that v9.14.8 is the latest available version of `@types/newrelic` on npm, and the `newrelic` package does not provide built-in TypeScript definitions. This major version gap means type definitions may be missing for APIs introduced in newrelic versions 10–13, potentially causing incomplete type coverage.\n\nConsider investigating whether the v9 types adequately cover v13 API usage, or check with DefinitelyTyped maintainers about updating the `@types/newrelic` package.\n\n<details>\n<summary>🤖 Prompt for AI Agents</summary>\n\n```\nIn `@package.json` at line 120, package.json currently lists\n`@types/newrelic`@^9.14.8 while the runtime newrelic is v13.10.0, causing\nmissing/incorrect typings; decide and apply one of these fixes: (A) if you can,\npin newrelic to a v9-compatible release to match `@types/newrelic`, (B) remove\n`@types/newrelic` and add a local ambient type stub (e.g., create\nsrc/types/newrelic.d.ts with either specific declarations for the newrelic APIs\nyour code uses or a minimal fallback like declare module 'newrelic';) then run\ntsc to find/implement any missing declarations, or (C) keep current versions and\nadd specific type augmentations for newer APIs used in your code; reference the\npackage names '@types/newrelic' and 'newrelic' and update package.json\naccordingly, then re-run the type-check and CI to confirm the issue is resolved.\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- fingerprinting:phantom:poseidon:ocelot -->\n\n<!-- This is an auto-generated comment by CodeRabbit -->","created_at":"2026-01-28T03:50:25Z","updated_at":"2026-01-28T03:50:26Z","html_url":"https://github.com/HutchisonSorbo/smalltalk.community/pull/93#discussion_r2734737257","pull_request_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HutchisonSorbo/smalltalk.community/pulls/93","_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/HutchisonSorbo/smalltalk.community/pulls/comments/2734737257"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/HutchisonSorbo/smalltalk.community/pull/93#discussion_r2734737257"},"pull_request":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/HutchisonSorbo/smalltalk.community/pulls/93"}},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HutchisonSorbo/smalltalk.community/pulls/comments/2734737257/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"start_line":null,"original_start_line":null,"start_side":null,"line":120,"original_line":120,"side":"RIGHT","author_association":"NONE","original_position":4,"position":4,"subject_type":"line"}]
