                board: [
                    { q: "How much time will this really take?", a: "Honest answer: Depends on your role. Chair: 6-8 hours/month Year 1 (setup), 4-5 ongoing. Secretary: 4-6 hours/month Year 1, 2-3 ongoing. Treasurer: 8-10 hours/month Year 1 (system setup/grants), 5-6 ongoing. Advisors: 2-3 hours/month. Year 1 is heavier than steady-state." },
                    { q: "What if the project stalls?", a: "We have clear decision gates: Month 4 (incorporation), Month 6 (funding), Month 10 (users). If we don't hit minimums (incorporated, $3k funding, 50 users), we pause to reassess or close responsibly. Ryan won't let this drag on indefinitely." },
                    { q: "Will I get paid?", a: "No, these are volunteer roles for at least Year 1-2. If we scale to $40k+ revenue by Year 3, Ryan may transition to part-time paid role, but board remains volunteer. We offer: governance experience, professional development, regional impact, and transparency." },
                    { q: "Why aren't Chair and Secretary roles in the prospectus yet?", a: "They are now! Initial prospectus was incomplete. Victorian incorporated associations LEGALLY REQUIRE Chair/President and Secretary as office-bearers. We've now added full role descriptions. These are non-negotiable for incorporation." },
                    { q: "What's Ryan's conflict of interest with Mitchell Shire Council?", a: "I work full time at Mitchell Shire Council. Mitigation: (1) Ryan recuses from board votes on Council partnerships/funding, (2) smalltalk.community Inc operates independently (not a Council program), (3) Annual conflict-of-interest declarations for all board members. This is documented in our governance charter." }

                    { q: "Is this sustainable?", a: "Year 1: Uncertain. We're a startup nonprofit with $5-20k projected revenue. Break-even is ~$11k/year. Conservative scenario ($5k) covers legal/insurance only, not programmes. Realistic scenario ($12.5k) allows modest activity. We're honest: this is bootstrap mode. Sustainability improves Year 2-3 as consulting revenue and partnerships mature." },
                    { q: "What is your competitive advantage?", a: "1) ONLY intergenerational platform in Mitchell/Murrindindi (youth, adults, seniors together). 2) Safety-first with professional multi-age safeguarding (not Facebook's self-moderation). 3) Co-designed WITH community, not FOR them. 4) Hyper-local focus (regional trust > metro scale). 5) Volunteer moderators invested in local relationships." },
                    { q: "What if grants don't come through?", a: "Conservative budget assumes $5k only (2 small grants). If we secure $0 by Month 6, we: (1) Pause platform build, (2) Run crowdfunding campaign ($3-5k target), OR (3) Pivot to consulting-first model (generate revenue via youth engagement workshops, fund platform Year 2). We won't accumulate debt or overcommit volunteers." },
                    { q: "Why should we fund you over established youth services?", a: "We're not competing with Headspace or Council programmes. We're filling a gap: 24/7 digital connection BETWEEN services. Youth need both professional support (existing orgs) AND peer/community connection (us). We partner with, not replace, existing providers. Our multigenerational angle is novel." }

We're commissioning a professional safeguarding policy ($2-3k, Month 1-3) covering youth protection, elder dignity, and intergenerational boundaries. We will NOT launch beta or public platform until policy is complete and board-approved (Month 3-4). Mandatory WWCC for volunteers. Moderation SLA: 24-48 hours (honest, given founder's 15hr/week availability)." },
                    { q: "Will my data be private?", a: "We comply with Australian Privacy Principles. Data stored via Mighty Networks (U.S. company, PENDING verification of Australian data residency compliance - Month 1 validation sprint). We NEVER sell user data. Privacy Policy will be legally reviewed before launch. You'll have right to export or delete your data." },
                    { q: "How can I get involved?", a: "8 pathways: (1) Youth Member, (2) Adult Mentor, (3) Senior Volunteer, (4) Organisation Partner, (5) Service Provider (skills exchange), (6) Board Member (governance), (7) Community Moderator (safety), (8) Project Sponsor (funding). See 'Get Involved' section. Note: Board and Moderator recruitment starts Month 2, community launch is Month 9-10." },
                    { q: "What happens if this doesn't work?", a: "We pivot or close responsibly. Decision gates at Month 4, 6, and 10. If community interviews (Month 2-3) show low demand, we pivot to offline events first. If grants fail, we try crowdfunding or consulting model. If we can't recruit board, we delay incorporation. If platform doesn't reach 50 users by Month 10, we assess whether to continue or archive the project. No shame in learning and adapting." }

                bio: "Youth Development Officer with five years experience working in regional Victoria. At 31, Ryan is a father of two living in Kilmore, deeply committed to building resilient, connected communities that bring all generations together. With hands-on experience in community development and a passion for leveraging technology, he's creating bridges between people of all ages and making genuine connection more accessible in the digital space.",
                why: "I see it every day, across all ages and backgrounds. Young people, parents, older community members, people living with disabilities, LGBTIQA+ community, First Nations peoples, culturally diverse families, everyone is searching for connection, opportunities, and ways to contribute. But isolation keeps us from collaborating, sharing skills, and building the kind of community we all want to live in. We need a digital space where all members of our community can genuinely connect with each other, share opportunities, and work together, not just exist in separate bubbles.",
