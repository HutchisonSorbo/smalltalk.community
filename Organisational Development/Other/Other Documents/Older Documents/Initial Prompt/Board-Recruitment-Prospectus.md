## Founding Director Recruitment Prospectus

**Join a Systems-Change Movement in Regional Victoria**

---

## The Moment We Are In

Regional Victoria is changing rapidly. Mitchell Shire is growing at a rate of 16 per cent per decade, making it one of Australia's fastest-growing regions. New residents arrive with few genuine connections to community life. Social isolation is increasing. Volunteer-led organisations are burning out, spending 70 per cent of their time on administration rather than community impact.

Murrindindi Shire is transitioning away from native timber harvesting. The economic shock is real. But so is the opportunity. Communities have the capability to diversify their economy around tourism, agriculture, and circular economy initiatives. What they lack is the infrastructure to collaborate at scale.

Meanwhile, local government budgets are tightening. Services are being rationalised. The burden of community wellbeing is shifting, slowly but inevitably, from government toward communities themselves.

This is not a crisis. It is an opening.

smalltalk.community was created to fill this opening. We are building digital infrastructure and governance frameworks that allow communities to lead their own futures. We are not another service provider. We are the connective tissue that allows existing capability to flourish.

And we need your help to build it.

## Who We Are

**smalltalk.community** is an Incorporated Association founded by Ryan Hutchison, a Youth Development Officer at Mitchell Shire Council with five years of experience in regional community work. Our team is small, our network is strong, and our commitment to genuine community change is uncompromising.

We are not a traditional non-profit seeking grant funding and survival. We are a social enterprise designed to be financially independent by 2029, built on a dual-revenue model (grants for seed funding, consulting and insights for long-term sustainability).

Our vision is a self-reliant, resilient regional Victoria where communities are the primary architects of their own social and economic wellbeing.

---

## What We Are Building

**The App Hub:** A suite of free, user-friendly digital applications that reduce administrative burden on volunteer organisations and enable community collaboration at scale.

**Gold-Standard Co-Design:** Genuine, ongoing community voice in how we are governed and what we build. Not consultation. Shared power.

**Systems Advocacy:** Using data and evidence to advocate for policy shifts that support local autonomy and community-led action.

**An Ethical Social Enterprise:** Revenue from consulting and insights (sold to councils, developers, government) cross-subsidises free access for residents and community organisations.

---

## Why Now?

Local government budgets are tightening. The window to build authentic community infrastructure before growth outpaces connection is narrow. Traditional top-down governance and service delivery are failing to respond to local needs. Communities must become self-reliant.

smalltalk.community has the MVP (Minimum Viable Product). We have proven the concept with early users. We have secured initial funding. What we need now is governance expertise and systems thinking to scale responsibly.

We are not looking for a "safe" board that meets quarterly and rubber-stamps decisions. We need directors who will challenge, think deeply, and help us navigate the complex intersection of community empowerment, technology, and social enterprise.

We need people who understand that governance is not compliance. It is the foundation for everything else.

---

## The Founding Director Roles

We are recruiting three visionary leaders to sit alongside Ryan Hutchison on our Board. Each role brings distinct expertise and fills a critical governance gap.

### Role A: Director of Finance and Sustainability (Treasurer)

**What we need from this role:**

You will establish and oversee the financial and governance framework for a growing social enterprise. You will ensure we remain compliant with ACNC requirements whilst building a sustainable dual-revenue model.

**Key responsibilities:**

- Set up Xero accounting and financial management systems that scale from $250,000 to $500,000+ revenue over five years.

- Develop and maintain a three-year rolling financial forecast (profit and loss, cashflow, balance sheet). Quarterly updates to Board.

- Oversee the transition from Incorporated Association to Company Limited by Guarantee (if required by growth).

- Manage the application for Deductible Gift Recipient (DGR) status, ensuring we meet ATO requirements.

- Ensure financial controls are in place; quarterly reconciliation of bank accounts, management of expenses, audit preparation.

- Advise on risk management and insurance requirements.

- Work with Founder to track and report on financial KPIs (revenue diversification, cost per user, consulting margins, burn rate).

- Build relationships with accountants, auditors, and tax advisors as the organisation grows.

- Guide decision-making around financial sustainability (e.g., when to hire, when to invest in development, when to cut costs).

**The ideal candidate:**

- CPA or CA qualified (or equivalent recognised qualification).

- Experience with Not-For-Profit financial governance (ideally 5+ years).

- Understanding of ACNC requirements and social enterprise financial models.

- Comfort with growth stage organisations (not just corporate finance).

- Patient teaching; able to explain finance to non-accountants.

- Pragmatic and decisive. No paralysis by analysis.

**What you are committing to:**

- Approximately 2-3 hours per month of "deep work" outside formal meetings (quarterly financial review, annual budget setting, special projects as they arise).

- One 90-minute Board meeting per month.

- Availability for text/email communication between meetings (usually quick responses to specific questions).

- Initial term: 2 years. Renewal after review.

---

### Role B: Director of Legal and Risk

**What we need from this role:**

You will protect the organisation's integrity and sustainability by managing legal compliance, data governance, intellectual property, and risk management. You will think systemically about how we operate, ensuring we can scale without legal exposure.

**Key responsibilities:**

- Finalise the Constitution (Rules of Association) and ensure compliance with Incorporated Associations Act (2015).

- Draft User Agreements and Privacy Policy for the platform (compliant with Privacy Act 1988 and Privacy Principles).

- Develop data governance protocols, including First Nations data sovereignty agreements.

- Advise on intellectual property strategy (what we own, what we licence, open-source considerations).

- Manage the transition from Association to Company Limited by Guarantee (when required).

- Identify and manage legal and operational risks (insurance coverage, regulatory exposure, employment law).

- Advise on governance best practice; help Board develop standing orders and decision-making protocols.

- Manage relationships with legal advisors and insurance brokers.

- Ensure compliance with state and federal legislation as we grow (Corporations Act if/when we incorporate, employment law, fundraising compliance).

- Think ahead. Anticipate legal issues before they become problems.

**The ideal candidate:**

- Legal professional with experience in not-for-profit law or tech law (ideally 5-10 years).

- Understanding of data privacy and cybersecurity (not deep expertise, but enough to ask the right questions).

- Experience with Incorporated Associations and social enterprise structures.

- Strong communicator; able to translate legal complexity into practical governance advice.

- Proactive and strategic. Not reactive.

**What you are committing to:**

- Approximately 2-3 hours per month of "deep work" (Constitution drafting, policy review, risk assessment).

- One 90-minute Board meeting per month.

- Availability between meetings for legal questions and urgent matters.

- Initial term: 2 years. Renewal after review.

### Role C: Director of Cultural Governance and Partnerships

**What we need from this role:**

smalltalk.community operates on Taungurung and Wurundjeri Woi-wurrung Country. Authentic community building is impossible without centering First Nations voice, authority, and data sovereignty. You will ensure this is not tokenistic. It is foundational.

This role is about genuine partnership, not consultation. You will hold us accountable to meaningful cultural relationships. You will ensure Traditional Owners have real decision-making power within the organisation.

**Key responsibilities:**

- Facilitate formal partnerships with Taungurung and Wurundjeri Woi-wurrung Traditional Owner Corporations.

- Develop and embed cultural protocols and governance frameworks (working within the Wurrek-al Framework).

- Ensure First Nations voice and data sovereignty are embedded in our digital design and co-design processes.

- Advise on accessibility and cultural appropriateness of all programs and communications.

- Coordinate the First Nations Co-Design Group (monthly meetings with community members from both nations).

- Develop and implement First Nations community engagement and capacity-building activities.

- Advise on how smalltalk.community can support Traditional Owner economic and cultural priorities.

- Build relationships with local First Nations organisations, arts groups, cultural educators, and elders.

- Hold the Board accountable to cultural commitments. If we are drifting toward tokenism, you will say so.

- Ensure annual independent review of cultural governance genuineness.

**The ideal candidate:**

- First Nations leader or established professional with 10+ years of deep, demonstrated experience in Aboriginal affairs and community leadership.

- Understanding of cultural sovereignty, data governance, and the difference between consultation and genuine partnership.

- Strong networks within local First Nations communities (both Taungurung and Wurundjeri Woi-wurrung).

- Passion for community-led change and cultural integrity.

- Ability to challenge the Board respectfully but firmly when cultural commitment wavers.

- Lived experience of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities (preferred but not essential; depth of engagement matters more than identity).

**What you are committing to:**

- Approximately 3-4 hours per month of deep work (co-design group facilitation, partnership relationship-building, policy development).

- One 90-minute Board meeting per month.

- Availability between meetings for cultural and community engagement matters.

- Initial term: 2 years. Renewal after review.

## Board Composition and Governance

The Board will consist of four directors:

1. **Ryan Hutchison** (Founder)
2. **Director of Finance and Sustainability** (Treasurer)
3. **Director of Legal and Risk**
4. **Director of Cultural Governance and Partnerships**

**Decision-making:** All Board decisions are made by consensus or majority vote (with one director, one vote). Ryan has no special voting power. Major decisions require Board approval: revenue generation, policy changes, strategic direction, risk management protocols.

**Advisory Layer:** A separate Community Advisory Council (12-15 members representing diverse demographics) advises the Board but does not hold formal governance authority. This ensures the Board can make rapid decisions whilst remaining accountable to community voice.

**Governance Principles:**

- **Slow is fast.** We are not chasing growth at the expense of integrity. We move deliberately.

- **Transparency is default.** Board minutes are shared with the Community Advisory Council and published publicly (with confidential matters redacted). Quarterly "State of smalltalk.community" reports are public.

- **Accountability is real.** If the organisation drifts from mission, the Board acknowledges it publicly and corrects course.

- **Power is distributed.** No single director dominates. Decisions are made together.

---

## Commitment Required

We acknowledge that our Board members have full-time careers, families, and other commitments. This is not a full-time role.

**Time commitment:**

- **Formal meetings:** 90 minutes per month (once monthly, scheduled in advance).

- **Deep work:** 2-4 hours per month outside of meetings. This includes preparing for Board meetings, specific projects (e.g., financial forecasting, legal reviews, partnership development), and responsiveness to urgent matters.

- **Flexibility:** Some months may require more time (e.g., budget setting, annual review). Others less.

**Total annual time commitment: 30-50 hours.**

This is meaningful but sustainable for someone with professional expertise and commitment to the cause.

**Term:**

- Initial term: 2 years.

- Renewal: Subject to annual review of performance, engagement, and mission alignment.

- No term limits, but we encourage rotating fresh perspectives. After two consecutive terms, consider stepping down or transitioning to Advisory Council role.

---

## The Opportunity

This is not a typical board role. We are building something genuinely new in regional Victoria. We are not managing decline. We are building infrastructure for community empowerment.

What you are committing to:

- Being part of a founding team that shapes how a new organisation operates from day one.

- Influencing policy and practice across two Shires (and potentially beyond).

- Ensuring that technology and governance serve community agency, not the reverse.

- Working alongside passionate, thoughtful people who are doing this work because they genuinely believe communities deserve better.

- Building something that lasts beyond any single person or funding cycle.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Why an Incorporated Association?

**A:** An Incorporated Association is the most accessible, member-led structure for a regional startup. It requires minimal bureaucracy, allows for flexible governance, and enables "slow is fast" growth while providing legal protections necessary to apply for Victorian state grants.

As we grow (or if we transition to a Company Limited by Guarantee for tax or governance reasons), the legal structure may change. An IA is the right starting point.

### Q: How will you compete with existing platforms (e.g., Slack, Teams, Jira)?

**A:** We don't compete. Most platforms are "top-down" (organisation-to-user) or "horizontal" (peer-to-peer within a closed group). smalltalk.community is "ecosystem" (connecting across sectors, demographics, and silos).

Slack is excellent for internal team communication. We are the platform that connects volunteer organisations, councils, local businesses, and residents in a single ecosystem. We are the hub, not another silo.

Additionally, existing platforms are not designed for rural digital divides, community-led governance, or First Nations data sovereignty. We fill a gap they don't address.

### Q: Is this actually sustainable?

**A:** Yes. Our financial model is not dependent on perpetual grant funding. By Year 3, we project 80 per cent of revenue from consulting and insights (selling community insights to councils, developers, government agencies). This is ethical because we charge those with capacity to pay, not vulnerable communities.

Additionally, we are approaching this as a sustainable organisation, not a charity. We will be financially independent by 2029. By 2030, we will be generating modest annual surplus ($20,000-$50,000) that is reinvested into community programs.

### Q: What if Ryan leaves?

**A:** This is a real risk, and we are managing it. By hiring strong second staff members (developers, engagement officers) in Year 1, we build institutional knowledge. By building a robust Board and Community Advisory Council, we distribute responsibility beyond the Founder.

Succession planning begins in Year 3 to ensure continuity if/when leadership changes. The organisation is designed to survive and thrive beyond any single person.

### Q: How do you ensure First Nations partnerships are genuine, not tokenistic?

**A:** We have built accountability mechanisms:

- First Nations director sits on the Board with equal authority (not advisory).

- Independent annual review of cultural governance genuineness (conducted by external First Nations consultant).

- Formal data sovereignty agreements with Traditional Owner Corporations.

- Budget allocation for First Nations capacity-building and compensation for co-design work (not volunteer).

- Regular feedback loop with Traditional Owners. If partnership drifts toward tokenism, we acknowledge it and rebuild.

Ultimately, this depends on the people involved. We need a Director of Cultural Governance who is willing to call out tokenism when they see it. If they are not, the commitment fails.

### Q: What happens if community needs conflict with financial sustainability?

**A:** This is an honest tension. We are managing it through:

1. **Dual-revenue model:** By diversifying revenue (grants, consulting, sponsorship), we are not dependent on any single funding source. If consulting revenue is declining, grants and sponsorship can temporarily sustain us whilst we rebuild.

2. **Mission as guardrail:** Our constitution commits us to serving community benefit, not shareholder return. If the organisation begins prioritising profit over impact, the Community Advisory Council and Board have standing to challenge this.

3. **Transparency:** We publish quarterly financial reports. If financial pressures are mounting, we communicate this openly and invite community input on priorities.

4. **Pragmatism:** There may be times when we need to make difficult choices. We will make them transparently, consult with community, and explain our reasoning clearly.

### Q: What if this doesn't work?

**A:** Failure is possible. Any startup faces uncertainty. What matters is how we fail.

If smalltalk.community cannot achieve financial sustainability, we will be transparent about this by Year 3 and make a clear decision: pivot (change our model), scale back (serve a smaller region more deeply), or transition (pass the work to another organisation).

We will not limp along for years on declining funding, pretending things are working when they are not. We owe communities better than that.

### Q: How much are you paying board members?

**A:** Founder compensation is modest (below median for the social sector) and only begins after financial stability is achieved. Board members receive no financial compensation. This is volunteer governance work, undertaken because you believe in the mission.

If you are seeking income, this is not the right role. If you are seeking to contribute your expertise to something meaningful, this is.

## Final Word

This is not a traditional board role. It requires thinking beyond the usual parameters: beyond grant-dependence, beyond tokenism, beyond "do more with less" austerity, and beyond siloed governance.

It requires believing that communities deserve agency. That digital infrastructure can support rather than replace human connection. That governance is not compliance but the foundation for everything else.

If this resonates, we would like to hear from you.

smalltalk.community is being built for people like you: thoughtful, committed, and unafraid to challenge conventional approaches.
