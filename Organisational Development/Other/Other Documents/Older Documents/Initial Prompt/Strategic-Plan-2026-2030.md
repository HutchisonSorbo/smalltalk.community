# smalltalk.community

## Strategic Plan 2026–2030

**Organisation:** smalltalk.community (Incorporated Association)  
**Status:** Strategic Plan for Board Review and Stakeholder Engagement  
**Date:** January 2026  
**Region:** Mitchell Shire and Murrindindi Shire, Victoria

---

## Executive Summary

smalltalk.community exists to solve a structural failure in regional Victoria: the absence of a unified digital and organisational infrastructure that enables communities to lead their own futures.

Mitchell Shire and Murrindindi Shire possess exceptional social capital, local expertise, and the will to create meaningful change. Yet this potential remains unrealised because volunteer organisations, community groups, local governments, and residents operate in isolation, managing their own tools, processes, and compliance requirements. The result is fragmentation, duplication of effort, and burnout among the very people who keep communities functioning.

smalltalk.community provides the connective tissue: a free digital hub of collaboration applications, paired with co-designed governance frameworks and evidence-based systems advocacy. We empower residents, volunteers, and local organisations to collaborate at scale, reduce administrative burden, and lead their own pathways to wellbeing and economic resilience.

This is not charity as usual. It is infrastructure as empowerment.

---

## Our Theory of Change

**The Problem:** Regional communities face a governance paradox. Top-down policy and service delivery struggle to respond quickly to local needs. Volunteer-led community action is authentic but unsustainable, consumed by compliance and administration. Digital platforms exist, but they remain siloed or externally controlled, capturing rather than returning value to the community.

**The Opportunity:** When communities have (1) accessible, free digital tools, (2) genuine voice in governance, and (3) data that demonstrates their impact, they become architects of their own resilience. This unlocks latent social capital and accelerates locally-led solutions that government and charity cannot deliver alone.

**Our Role:** We are infrastructure. We provide the systems, data, and governance frameworks that allow community-led action to flourish. We are not another service provider. We are the platform that connects existing capability.

---

## Vision and Mission

**Vision:** A self-reliant, resilient regional Victoria where communities are the primary architects of their own social and economic wellbeing, operating from genuine agency rather than dependency.

**Mission:** To provide the digital infrastructure, governance frameworks, and systems advocacy necessary for universal, non-tokenistic community collaboration across Mitchell and Murrindindi Shires.

### Strategic Principles

1. **Universal, not tokenistic.** We serve all demographics simultaneously: First Nations peoples, CALD residents, LGBTIQA+ communities, people with disability, neurodivergent individuals, early childhood, youth, parents, seniors, and local businesses. No demographic is an afterthought or secondary focus.

2. **Bottom-up, not top-down.** We centre the voices and agency of residents and volunteers, not government or funder mandates. Our platform is designed with the people who use it, not for them.

3. **Systemic, not symptomatic.** We address structural barriers to community collaboration and resilience, not just fund individual projects. This means advocating for policy change alongside service delivery.

4. **Regional, not metropolitan.** Mitchell and Murrindindi Shires face distinct economic, demographic, and environmental challenges. Our approach is hyperlocal, grounded in the specific context of these regions and the First Nations peoples whose land this is.

5. **Sustainable, not extractive.** We build a financial model that does not depend on perpetual grant funding or the exploitation of volunteer labour. We invest in our own revenue generation to protect our independence and long-term sustainability.

## Regional Context and Strategic Justification

### The Mitchell Shire Growth Challenge

Mitchell Shire is one of Australia's fastest-growing regions. Between 2016 and 2021, population grew by 16.2 per cent (compared to Victorian average of 8.6 per cent). By 2050, Mitchell is projected to grow to over 400,000 residents.

This growth is economically significant but socially risky. Rapid expansion creates "dormitory suburbs" where residents commute to Melbourne for work and have minimal connection to local community life. The infrastructure (roads, schools, community facilities) struggles to keep pace. Social isolation increases, particularly among young families, parents, seniors, and newly arrived residents.

**Early Intervention Opportunity:** Mitchell Shire Health Profile (2024) identifies social isolation as an emerging risk factor across multiple demographics. Community loneliness is associated with poor mental health outcomes, reduced civic engagement, and weakened informal support networks. The window to build authentic community connection during rapid growth is narrow. smalltalk.community provides the connective infrastructure that transforms new residents into active community members.

Additionally, Mitchell is home to the traditional Country of the Taungurung and Wurundjeri Woi-wurrung peoples. Genuine community building requires First Nations leadership and co-design, not as a consultation checkbox but as foundational governance.

### The Murrindindi Transition Challenge

Murrindindi Shire has historically depended on native timber harvesting as a primary economic driver and employer. The cessation of native forest logging creates both economic shock and opportunity.

According to Murrindindi's Economic Development Strategy and the "Shaping Murrindindi's Future" transition initiative, the Shire is pursuing diversification into visitor economy, agriculture and aquaculture, farm forestry, agroforestry, and sustainable circular economy models.

**Implementation Reality:** These strategies are aspirational but implementation is fragmented. Individual farmers, tourism operators, and small businesses operate independently. There is no unified platform for knowledge sharing, collaborative supply chains, or collective market access. Value-add opportunities (processing, tourism aggregation, regional branding) remain underdeveloped.

smalltalk.community provides the digital infrastructure for collaboration that these strategies require. By connecting farmers, tourism providers, local manufacturers, and service providers, we enable the collective action necessary to create genuine economic alternatives to forestry.

### The Governance Gap: The 70 Per Cent Problem

A 2024 scan of volunteer-led community organisations across Mitchell and Murrindindi identified a critical issue: volunteer leaders spend approximately 70 per cent of their time on administration and compliance, and 30 per cent on actual community impact.

This is not sustainable. Burnout is endemic. The work that matters gets pushed to the edges.

**Administration burden includes:**

- Managing volunteer rosters, training logs, and working with children checks
- Producing funding reports and acquittal documentation
- Managing email lists, Facebook pages, and multiple digital platforms
- Complying with ACNC, workplace health and safety, privacy, and insurance requirements
- Tracking community assets and resources
- Organising meetings, recording decisions, and producing minutes

**The Cost:** Thousands of volunteer hours are lost to tools and processes that do not generate community value. Many organisations lack the capacity to access technology or funding support to improve this. The poorest communities, with the greatest need, are often the least equipped to navigate complex digital tools.

smalltalk.community automates the "boring stuff." Our app hub includes volunteer management, resource sharing, local advocacy, meeting recording and decision tracking, and compliance documentation. By reducing administration burden from 70 per cent to 30 per cent, we free volunteers to focus on what matters: relationships, local action, and genuine community change.

### First Nations Reconciliation as Prerequisite

smalltalk.community operates on Taungurung and Wurundjeri Woi-wurrung Country. Authentic community building is impossible without centering First Nations voice, authority, and data sovereignty.

Too many initiatives treat First Nations consultation as a compliance step. We reject this approach entirely. We are committed to genuine partnership:

- First Nations leaders hold governance positions on our Board (see Director of Cultural Governance & Partnerships role).
- Our co-design process follows the Wurrek-al Framework, which centres cultural knowledge and authority.
- Data collected through our platform regarding First Nations communities remains under First Nations control (data sovereignty).
- Our digital design reflects cultural values and accessibility needs specific to our Traditional Owners.

This is not virtue signalling. It is foundational to our legitimacy and effectiveness.

## Strategic Pillars: How We Create Change

### Pillar 1: The App Hub (Digital Infrastructure)

**What it is:** A suite of free, user-friendly digital applications designed to reduce administrative burden and increase collaboration capacity across volunteer organisations, community groups, local councils, and residents.

**The apps (initial suite):**

- **Volunteer Manager:** Rostering, working with children checks, training logs, hours tracking, and recognition systems. Integrates with ACNC compliance requirements.

- **Resource Hub:** Community asset mapping. Organisations and residents can list available resources (equipment, spaces, expertise) and find what they need. Enables resource sharing and prevents duplication.

- **Advocacy & Change Platform:** Communities can identify local issues, gather evidence, coordinate advocacy campaigns, and track outcomes. Built for residents to lead, not for organisations to manage them.

- **Meeting Manager:** Records meetings, captures decisions, assigns actions, tracks accountability. Produces compliant documentation suitable for funding applications and board reporting.

- **Skills & Knowledge Exchange:** Communities can post what they know and what they need to learn. Connects peer educators with learners. Supports intergenerational and cross-cultural knowledge transfer.

- **Event & Activity Coordination:** Planning, registration, accessibility tracking, attendance management. Integrated with volunteer management and resource hub.

**Design Principles:**

- **Accessibility first.** The platform is usable on low-bandwidth connections, works on mobile devices, has built-in screen reader compatibility, and includes multiple language options. We design for the person with the least access to technology, not the most.

- **No forced integration.** Communities can use one app or many. The hub is modular. Organisations are not locked in.

- **Offline functionality.** Users can work offline and sync when connected. This is critical in rural regions where internet connectivity is inconsistent.

- **Data ownership.** Communities own their data. They can export it, request deletion, or move to another platform. We do not monetise community data.

- **User feedback loop.** Development priorities are determined by community need, not donor preference. Quarterly surveys and co-design sessions ensure the platform evolves with community use.

**Investment and Scale:**

- **Phase 1 (2026):** Launch Volunteer Manager and Resource Hub. Pilot with 20-30 community organisations across both Shires.

- **Phase 2 (2027):** Add Advocacy & Change Platform and Meeting Manager. Expand to 50-60 organisations. Integrate First Nations data sovereignty protocols.

- **Phase 3 (2028-2029):** Add Skills Exchange and Event Coordination. Reach 100+ organisations. Begin integration with council planning systems.

- **Phase 4 (2030):** Platform is self-sustaining. Community governance takes primary decision-making role. Scaling to adjacent regions begins.

**Technology Stack:** Open-source, cloud-hosted, with local Victorian hosting to ensure data remains in Australia. No reliance on US-based platforms or proprietary software that creates dependency.

### Pillar 2: Gold-Standard Co-Design and Governance

**What it is:** A commitment to genuine, ongoing community voice in how smalltalk.community is governed and developed. This is not a consultation exercise. It is shared power.

**Governance Structure:**

- **Board of Directors:** 4 positions (Founder, Finance, Legal & Risk, Cultural Governance). Board members represent governance expertise, not a broad "community voice." (See Board Recruitment section below.)

- **Community Advisory Council:** 12-15 residents and leaders from across Mitchell and Murrindindi, representing diverse demographics (First Nations, CALD, LGBTIQA+, disability advocates, youth, seniors, parents, local business). Members serve 2-year terms. They meet quarterly to advise the Board and directly influence platform development priorities.

- **Sector Leaders Forum:** Quarterly meetings with key organisations (councils, health services, schools, major NGOs) to align smalltalk.community with broader system goals and identify collaboration opportunities.

- **Demographic-Specific Co-Design Groups:** Monthly working groups focused on specific needs (e.g., "Youth Co-Design Group," "First Nations Data Sovereignty Group," "Rural Accessibility Group"). These groups test new features, provide feedback, and shape product roadmap.

**Co-Design Methodologies:**

We employ evidence-based community engagement frameworks:

- **IAP2 Spectrum:** We are transparent about decision-making authority. Some decisions are ours to make (technical security). Most decisions (feature priorities, design, accessibility) are genuinely collaborative.

- **Wurrek-al Framework:** Developed by and for Taungurung and Wurundjeri Woi-wurrung peoples, this framework centres cultural authority, reciprocal obligation, and long-term relationship-building. It replaces extractive consultation models.

- **Neurodiversity-Affirming Design:** We work with neurodivergent individuals throughout design and testing to ensure the platform is genuinely accessible, not just compliant.

- **Universal Design for Learning:** Features are designed to be usable by the widest possible range of people without needing to be adapted or customised.

**Accountability:**

- Quarterly "State of smalltalk.community" reports are published and shared with Community Advisory Council, demonstrating what we committed to building, what we actually built, and why.

- Annual independent audit of co-design processes to ensure they are genuine and not tokenistic.

- Demographic representation on Advisory Council is tracked and published publicly. If representation is declining, the Board must explain why and take corrective action.

---

### Pillar 3: Systems Advocacy

**What it is:** Using data, evidence, and community voice to advocate for policy and structural changes that support community autonomy and local resilience.

**The Reality:** Even with the best digital tools and community engagement, systemic barriers remain. Funding models reward large organisations over grassroots groups. Compliance requirements are designed for bureaucracies, not volunteers. First Nations data sovereignty is not enshrined in law. Young people are excluded from decision-making that affects them.

We collect data on these barriers through our platform and use that evidence to advocate for change.

**Advocacy Priorities (2026-2030):**

1. **Simplifying NFP Compliance:** Many small organisations cannot access the expertise needed to comply with ACNC requirements. We will work with government and sector bodies to develop simplified compliance pathways for grassroots organisations with budgets under $100,000.

2. **Youth Voice in Local Government:** We will advocate for mandatory youth representation in council decision-making (e.g., youth representative on planning committees, youth veto power on certain decisions affecting young people).

3. **First Nations Data Sovereignty:** We will work with Traditional Owner Corporations to develop principles for how community data collected by government and NGOs should be governed and returned to community.

4. **Digital Equity Funding:** We will advocate for dedicated funding streams for regional digital infrastructure, not as charity but as essential infrastructure investment equivalent to roads or water.

5. **Community Facilities as Hub:** We will advocate that council and state government invest in community facilities as universal hubs (not silos for specific demographics), where health services, youth programs, aged care, and local government co-locate and share infrastructure.

**Advocacy Methods:**

- Annual "Community Insights Report" (data from our platform) shared with councils, state government, and federal MPs, demonstrating what communities need and what barriers exist.

- Participation in government and sector advisory groups (e.g., Regional Victoria Commissioner's office, Department of Families, Fairness and Housing).

- Coalition-building with other sector organisations to amplify community voice.

- Public advocacy through media, events, and policy forums when necessary.

- Direct engagement with local Members of Parliament and council members.

## Financial Sustainability: The Ethical Social Enterprise Model

smalltalk.community operates a dual-revenue model designed to achieve financial independence by 2029 and reinvest profits into greater community benefit.

### Revenue Stream 1: Grants (Years 1-2)

**Purpose:** Fund product development, community co-design, and foundational governance.

**Targets:**
- Victorian Government social enterprise grants ($50,000-$150,000 per year)
- Philanthropic foundations (e.g., Lord Mayor's Charitable Foundation, Gandel Foundation)
- Community enterprise grants (e.g., Uniting Communities, Good2Give)

**Timeline:** Primarily Years 1-2. Grants are seed funding, not ongoing operational support.

**Dependency Risk Mitigation:** We will not build permanent staff roles dependent on grants. Grants fund product development, not operations. By Year 3, grants should represent less than 20 per cent of total revenue.

### Revenue Stream 2: Consulting and Insights (Years 1-5)

**What we sell:** High-level "Community Insight Reports" and consulting services to councils, developers, and government agencies.

**The Model:**

- Property developers planning new estates in Mitchell Shire hire smalltalk.community to conduct community needs assessment and design community engagement strategy. ($30,000-$50,000 per engagement)

- Councils use our platform data to inform community planning and advocate to state government for funding. We provide quarterly "State of Community" reports. ($15,000-$25,000 per year per council)

- State government agencies seek evidence on community needs, barriers, and solutions. We provide research and co-design support. ($20,000-$80,000 per project)

- Local businesses seek community insights to inform product and service design. We provide anonymised, aggregated insights. ($5,000-$20,000 per engagement)

**Ethical Boundaries:**

- We never sell individual-level data or identify community members.
- We never accept work that contradicts our mission (e.g., we will not work for a developer planning a project that displaces vulnerable communities).
- We never charge for insights about disadvantaged communities; only commercial and government entities are charged.
- All revenue is reinvested into the platform or community programs.

**Sustainability Rationale:**

This model is ethical because:
1. We are not extracting value from communities; we are helping councils and developers become more responsive to community need.
2. Revenue comes from those with capacity to pay (government, corporate), not from vulnerable people.
3. It generates meaningful income ($150,000-$250,000 per year) without mission drift.
4. It leverages our core expertise (community engagement and data) rather than requiring new business lines.

**Financial Projections:**

- **Year 1 (2026):** $80,000 (one council contract + one developer engagement)
- **Year 2 (2027):** $180,000 (two councils + two developer engagements + some government work)
- **Year 3 (2028):** $280,000 (expanding council base + state government contracts)
- **Year 4 (2029):** $350,000+ (platform scaled, multiple revenue streams mature)
- **Year 5 (2030):** $400,000-$450,000 target (50-60 per cent of total revenue)

### Revenue Stream 3: Platform Sponsorship and Partnerships

**What it is:** Corporate and social enterprise partners sponsor features or functionality in exchange for branding and co-design involvement.

**Examples:**

- A rural health service sponsor a "Mental Health Check-In" feature within the app hub, providing resources and referral pathways.
- A local bank sponsor a "Financial Wellbeing" content series, reaching community members through the platform.
- A telecommunications company sponsors improved offline functionality and low-bandwidth optimization.

**Ethical Boundaries:**

- Sponsorship is transparent (users know a feature is sponsored and by whom).
- Sponsors do not influence the feature's underlying functionality or data collection.
- We prioritise community benefit over sponsor branding.
- We decline sponsorship that conflicts with mission (e.g., we will not accept sponsorship from predatory lending companies or fast-fashion retailers).

**Financial Projection:**

- Year 1-2: $0 (too early; focus on core product)
- Year 3-5: $30,000-$60,000 per year (3-5 meaningful partnerships)

### Operating Budget (Indicative)

**Year 1 (2026):**
- Personnel: $160,000 (Founder FTE + 0.5 FTE Developer)
- Development & Technology: $40,000
- Co-design and community engagement: $30,000
- Governance and compliance: $15,000
- Marketing and communications: $15,000
- **Total:** $260,000

Funded by: $100,000 grant + $80,000 consulting revenue + $80,000 reserve/philanthropy.

**Year 3 (2028):**
- Personnel: $220,000 (Founder FTE + 1 FTE Developer + 0.5 FTE Engagement Officer)
- Development & Technology: $60,000
- Co-design and community engagement: $50,000
- Governance and compliance: $25,000
- Marketing and communications: $20,000
- **Total:** $375,000

Funded by: $50,000 grants (declining) + $280,000 consulting revenue + $45,000 sponsorship.

**Year 5 (2030):**
- Personnel: $300,000 (Founder FTE + 2 FTE Developers + 1 FTE Engagement Officer)
- Development & Technology: $80,000
- Co-design and community engagement: $80,000
- Governance and compliance: $30,000
- Marketing and communications: $30,000
- **Total:** $520,000

Funded by: $30,000 grants (minimal) + $430,000 consulting revenue + $60,000 sponsorship.

By Year 5, the organisation is operationally self-sustaining and generating modest surplus ($20,000-$50,000) annually, which is reinvested into expanded community programs or platform development.

## Risk Management and Mitigation

### Risk 1: Technology Adoption Barriers

**Risk:** Community organisations lack the digital literacy or access to use the platform effectively.

**Mitigation:**
- Free training and support (webinars, in-person workshops, phone support).
- Offline-first design; platform works without internet.
- Community "Digital Champions" program: train volunteers to support their peers.
- Dedicated support line (phone, email, chat) for technical issues.
- Beginner-friendly onboarding; no jargon.

### Risk 2: Funding Shortfall

**Risk:** Grants do not materialise or consulting revenue grows slower than projected.

**Mitigation:**
- Conservative financial projections; assume grants represent only 50 per cent of target.
- Runway of 18-24 months operational reserve from initial funding.
- Flexible staffing model; can reduce hours or defer non-critical development if needed.
- Multiple revenue sources reduce dependency on single funder.
- Philanthropy relationship-building occurs continuously, not during grant cycles.

### Risk 3: Key Person Dependency

**Risk:** Organisation is overly dependent on Founder's relationships and expertise.

**Mitigation:**
- Hire strong second staff member (Developer) in Year 1 to build institutional knowledge.
- Board recruitment prioritises people with relevant sector networks and expertise.
- Advisory Council serves as distributed leadership and relationship layer.
- Documentation of all processes and relationships.
- Succession planning begins in Year 3 to ensure continuity.

### Risk 4: Data Security and Privacy Breach

**Risk:** Community data is mishandled, hacked, or breached, causing harm to vulnerable community members.

**Mitigation:**
- Director of Legal & Risk oversees all data governance.
- Enterprise-grade cloud security (encrypted data at rest and in transit).
- Regular third-party security audits (annual).
- Privacy by design; platform collects minimum necessary data.
- Clear data retention policies; data deleted after defined period.
- Cyber insurance.
- Breach response protocol in place; affected communities notified within 48 hours.

### Risk 5: Mission Drift

**Risk:** Pressure to grow revenue leads to acceptance of contracts or partnerships that undermine community mission.

**Mitigation:**
- Board approval required for all revenue-generating activities.
- Mission and values statement reviewed annually by Advisory Council.
- Public commitment: "We will never accept funding or partnerships that require us to compromise our mission."
- Annual independent review of mission alignment (third-party auditor).
- If drift begins to occur, Advisory Council has standing to challenge Board decision.

### Risk 6: First Nations Consultation Remains Tokenistic

**Risk:** Despite commitment to genuine partnership, Traditional Owners are consulted but not truly empowered in governance or decision-making.

**Mitigation:**
- First Nations leader sits on Board with decision-making authority equal to other directors.
- Data sovereignty protocol developed with Traditional Owners and embedded in legal agreements.
- Annual external review of cultural governance genuineness (conducted by independent First Nations consultant).
- Budget allocation for First Nations capacity-building and compensation for co-design work (not volunteer).
- Regular feedback loop from Traditional Owners; if partnership is not genuine, it is ended, and relationship rebuilt.

## Conclusion: The Moment We Are In

Regional Victoria is at an inflection point. Rapid growth in Mitchell Shire risks creating disconnected, atomised suburbs. Murrindindi's transition away from native timber logging requires genuine economic diversification and community collaboration. Local government budgets are tightening. The burden of community wellbeing is shifting, slowly but inevitably, toward communities themselves.

This is not a crisis to be solved by more government spending or charity. It is an opportunity to build infrastructure that allows communities to lead their own futures.

smalltalk.community is that infrastructure.

We do not ask communities to depend on us. We ask them to use us as a tool to connect with each other. We do not replace volunteer energy; we amplify it by removing the administrative friction. We do not make decisions for communities; we ensure their voices are genuine and their authority is real.

Over five years, we will build a digital platform and governance model that becomes synonymous with community agency in regional Victoria. By 2030, smalltalk.community will be the connective layer that allows communities to be self-reliant, resilient, and genuinely in charge of their own futures.

This is the work we do. This is why we exist.
