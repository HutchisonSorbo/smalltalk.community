# **Strategic Operational Framework 2026: Governance, Sustainability, and Risk Mitigation for smalltalk.community**

## **Executive Summary**

The establishment of smalltalk.community represents a calculated intervention into the social fabric of Murrindindi Shire, designed to address specific, data-verified gaps in community cohesion, mental health accessibility, and digital inclusion. This report outlines a rigorous strategic pathway for the organisation's foundation, operationalisation, and growth throughout 2026, explicitly tailored to the unique constraints and opportunities of the founder’s professional circumstances.

Operating within the complex socio-political ecosystem of regional Victoria requires a sophisticated understanding of both the "hard" infrastructure of compliance and the "soft" infrastructure of community trust. The founder’s continued full-time employment with Mitchell Shire Council throughout 2026 necessitates a strategy defined by a strict and permanent "Geographical Firewall," isolating operations to Murrindindi Shire to negate conflict of interest risks. This constraint, rather than limiting the organisation, provides a strategic focus that aligns perfectly with the identified needs of the Murrindindi region, a municipality characterised by dispersed townships, a legacy of disaster resilience, and a "missing middle" in mental health and social support services.

This framework leverages a low-cost, high-impact digital model. By positioning the website as the primary networking tool and utilising the "Non-Profit Industrial Complex" of software donations and grants, smalltalk.community can achieve significant operational capacity with minimal financial outlay. The roadmap details a month-by-month execution plan for 2026 that prioritises governance, digital infrastructure, and stakeholder engagement, ensuring that the organisation grows sustainably as a compliant, trusted, and integrated entity within the regional support ecosystem, all while respecting the founder's full-time work commitments.

## **1\. Regional Ecosystem Analysis: The Murrindindi Context**

To build a holistic framework that unites the community ecosystem, one must first deconstruct the sociodemographic and psychographic reality of the target region. Murrindindi Shire is not a monolith, it is a tapestry of distinct communities including Kinglake, Marysville, Yea, Alexandra, and Eildon, each with unique identities, histories, and challenges.

### **1.1 The Sociodemographic and Mental Health Landscape**

The primary justification for the establishment of smalltalk.community lies in the stark data regarding health and wellbeing in the Shire. The *Murrindindi Shire Council Plan 2021-2025* and the *Municipal Public Health and Wellbeing Plan* serve as critical foundational documents, revealing a community that is resilient yet vulnerable. The data indicates that compared to the Victorian state average, the community of Murrindindi suffers from higher levels of mental health concerns.1 This is not merely a statistical anomaly but a reflection of structural and geographic realities. The prevalence of adults reporting psychological distress and loneliness contributes to a higher rate of seeking professional help, yet this is paradoxically matched by a significant community perception that local mental health services are lacking.1

This disconnect, between the need for help and the visibility of help, is the precise gap smalltalk.community must fill. In rural settings, the barrier to accessing mental health support is often not just availability, but *anonymity* and *approachability*. Walking into a clinical setting in a small town where everyone knows everyone can be a barrier. A digital-first, community-led platform offers a "soft entry" point. It allows residents to connect based on shared interests or low-stakes social interaction ("small talk"), which serves as a preventative measure against the acute isolation that precipitates mental health crises.

### **1.2 The Shadow of 2009: Disaster Recovery and Community Psychology**

It is impossible to operate effectively in Murrindindi without navigating the legacy of the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires. This event did not just damage infrastructure, it fundamentally rewired the social and psychological DNA of the region. Research indicates that years post-disaster, reconstruction in areas like Murrindindi was still proceeding slowly due to the unavailability of building resources and changed building standards.2

This history has cultivated a specific community psychology: a fierce independence combined with a skepticism of "outside" bureaucracy. Residents have witnessed waves of well-meaning consultants and government agencies promise recovery and depart when funding cycles ended. Consequently, trust is the most valuable and scarce currency in the region. smalltalk.community must avoid the optics of a "fly-in-fly-out" service. The strategy must be rooted in *permanence* and *local ownership*.

### **1.3 The "Missing Middle" in Service Delivery**

Current service delivery in Murrindindi is polarised. On one end, there are statutory services and large providers like Nexus Primary Health and Menzies Support Services delivering critical aged and disability care.3 On the other, there are informal, hyper-local volunteer groups (CFAs, sports clubs). What is missing is the connective tissue, the "holistic framework" that helps a resident navigate between these silos.

The Council’s engagement feedback highlights a community desire to "prioritise access and inclusion, especially for our LGBTQI+ community, people with disabilities, and those who feel left out or unheard".1 smalltalk.community can function as the universal solvent, breaking down these silos by offering a platform where a young LGBTIQA+ person in Yea can find a queer-friendly book club, or a person with a disability in Kinglake can find a map of mobility recharge points.

## **2\. Governance Framework and Conflict of Interest Management**

The operational constraint of the founder’s employment at Mitchell Shire Council is the single most critical governance variable. Managing this requires a strategy that goes beyond simple disclosure, it requires structural separation.

### **2.1 The Mitchell Shire Employment Constraint**

As a full-time employee of Mitchell Shire Council, the founder is bound by the *Local Government Act 2020* and the Council’s *Employee Code of Conduct*. These documents are explicit regarding secondary employment and conflicts of interest.

* **Code of Conduct Requirements:** Employees must ensure that personal behaviour is consistent with Council values and that any outside work does not lead to a conflict of interest or affect Council time and resources.4  
* **The "Geographical Firewall":** To mitigate this, the strategy employs a strict geographic delineation. smalltalk.community will define its "Area of Benefit" in its constitution strictly as "Murrindindi Shire and immediate surrounds," explicitly excluding Mitchell Shire from its active programming. This ensures that the founder is never in a position of soliciting funds or resources from their employer.

### **2.2 Board Composition and the Role of Cass**

Governance in an Incorporated Association relies on the Committee of Management. With the founder’s time constrained, the role of the Co-founder, Cass, becomes pivotal.

* **The Chairperson’s Strategic Function:** The Chair is responsible for "governing," not "managing." Cass does not need to run the website or write grant applications. Her role is to chair meetings, ensure the organisation adheres to its rules, and act as the primary signatory.6  
* **Risk Mitigation for Cass:** To minimise liability for Cass while maximising her utility, the Association’s rules must include an indemnity clause for office holders acting in good faith.7

## **3\. Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework**

Effective risk management moves beyond a simple "tick-box" compliance exercise. It serves as a dynamic decision-making tool. For a Victorian-based organisation, this involves aligning with the Victorian Government's risk management guidelines for community organisations.8

### **3.1 Comprehensive Risk Register**

The following register identifies the most critical vulnerabilities specific to smalltalk.community. It uses a standard Likelihood x Consequence matrix to determine risk ratings.

| Risk Category | Specific Risk Scenario | Likelihood | Consequence | Risk Rating | Mitigation Strategy & Treatment Plan |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Human Capital** | **Founder Burnout / Incapacitation:** The cumulative effect of "always-on" responsibility leads to sudden resignation or health-related absence. | **Almost Certain** | **Major** | **EXTREME** | 1\. Implement "Core Hours" protocol (See Section 5). 2\. Document all processes in a "Founder's Manual" (SOPs). 3\. Recruit a "Shadow Deputy" or Vice-President by Q3 2026\. |
| **Financial** | **Google Ad Grant Suspension:** Loss of the $10k/month grant due to CTR dropping below 5% or policy violations (e.g. single-word keywords). | **Possible** | **Moderate** | **HIGH** | 1\. Weekly audit of keywords to remove single-word terms.9 2\. Remove all placeholder text/broken links immediately. 3\. Diversify traffic sources (social media) so reliance is not 100% on Google. |
| **Governance** | **Key Person Unavailable (Cass):** Cass becomes unavailable due to personal circumstances, leaving the Chair position vacant. | **Possible** | **Moderate** | **MEDIUM** | 1\. Constitution allows for "Casual Vacancy" to be filled by Committee vote, not AGM. 2\. Recruit a third "General Member" to the committee in Q2 2026 to act as backup Chair. |
| **Reputational** | **Community Complaint:** A user posts harmful content or makes a complaint that attracts media attention or Council scrutiny. | **Possible** | **Major** | **HIGH** | 1\. Strict moderation policy (See Section 4). 2\. Clear "Complaints Handling Policy" on the footer of the website.10 3\. Founder recusal from any public comment if it involves Council matters. |
| **Technical** | **Platform Lock-out / Data Loss:** Catastrophic failure of Wix servers or accidental deletion of the user database. | **Unlikely** | **Major** | **HIGH** | 1\. Implement "3-2-1" backup rule. 2\. Weekly manual CSV export of member data to a secure, separate drive. 3\. Automated Zapier backup to Google Sheets (See Section 6). |

### **3.2 Succession and Contingency Planning**

* **The "Bus Factor" of 1:** Currently, the organisation fails if the founder is unavailable.  
* **Contingency Protocol:**  
  * **Access:** A sealed physical envelope (or digital equivalent like a password manager emergency access) containing admin logins for Wix, Google, and Banking must be accessible to Cass.  
  * **Authority:** The Constitution must explicitly state that in the event of the Secretary's incapacity, the Chair (Cass) automatically assumes temporary administrative authority until a meeting can be called.

## **4\. Data Privacy, Security & Safeguarding**

For smalltalk.community, data privacy is not merely a legal obligation under the *Privacy Act 1988* (Cth) but the foundation of user trust. Users sharing feelings of loneliness are providing sensitive data.

### **4.1 Privacy Policy and APPs**

The organisation must adopt a "Privacy by Design" approach.

* **Policy Requirement:** A clearly expressed Privacy Policy must be published on the website before launch. It must state *what* is collected, *why*, and *who* sees it.11  
* **Data Minimisation:** Do not collect "nice to have" data. If you don't need a phone number, don't ask for it. This reduces the blast radius of any potential breach.

### **4.2 Safeguarding and Duty of Care**

The organisation must align with the **11 Victorian Child Safe Standards**, enforced by the Commission for Children and Young People (CCYP), even if the primary audience is adults.12

* **Online Grooming Prevention:** Moderation guidelines must strictly prohibit moving conversations to unmonitored private channels (e.g. WhatsApp/Telegram). All interaction should remain on the platform where it can be moderated.  
* **Mandatory Reporting:** All volunteers must be trained that if a user discloses historical or current abuse of a minor, this *must* be escalated to the Founder immediately for reporting to police. There is no "confidentiality" protection for child abuse.13

### **4.3 Content Moderation and Mental Health**

* **Vicarious Trauma:** Moderators are at risk of psychological injury from reading distressing content.  
* **Protocol:**  
  * **The "Signposting" Rule:** Moderators are not counsellors. Their only role is to listen and *signpost* to professional services (Lifeline, Beyond Blue). They must never offer clinical advice.14  
  * **Automated Filters:** Use Wix or third-party tools to automatically flag keywords associated with self-harm, triggering an automatic pop-up with crisis numbers.

## **5\. Human Capital Sustainability: Preventing Founder Burnout**

The roadmap relies on the founder working full-time at Mitchell Shire Council while building this charity. This is a recipe for burnout unless strictly managed.

### **5.1 The "Core Hours" Protocol**

To operationalise boundaries, the organisation defines "Charity Operating Hours":

* **Weekdays:** 6:30 PM – 8:00 PM (Tuesday & Thursday only).  
* **Weekends:** Saturday 9:00 AM – 12:00 PM.  
* **Total Weekly Cap:** 6 hours maximum.  
* **The "Blackout" Period:** No charity emails or slack messages are to be sent during Council work hours (8:30 AM – 5:00 PM). This is critical for Conflict of Interest management and mental separation.

### **5.2 Burnout Early-Warning System**

* **Monthly Check-in:** A standing 15-minute agenda item between Cass and Founder: "Traffic Light Assessment."  
  * *Green:* Energy good, tasks on track.  
  * *Amber:* Feeling tired, slipping on Council work or family time. **Action:** Pause all new website features for 2 weeks.  
  * *Red:* Dread, exhaustion, cynicism. **Action:** Mandatory 1-week total shutdown of charity operations (website remains up, but no active work).

## **6\. Digital Infrastructure & Resilience**

### **6.1 Website Technical Safeguards**

* **Backup Strategy:** Wix backups are session-based. They do not always restore database content perfectly.15  
  * *Requirement:* Weekly manual export of the "Members" and "Events" collections to CSV. Store these in a secure Google Drive folder separate from the main account.  
* **Access Control:**  
  * *Admin:* Only the Founder has "Owner" access.  
  * *Cass:* Has "Admin" access (can manage but not delete the site).  
  * *Volunteers:* Given restricted "Editor" or "Blogger" roles only. They never get full admin rights.

### **6.2 Mobile Optimisation**

Murrindindi has areas of poor mobile data coverage.

* **Low-Bandwidth Design:** The site must be optimised for 3G speeds. Avoid heavy video backgrounds. Use "Lazy Loading" for images.16  
* **Test:** Regularly test the site using Google's "Lighthouse" tool to ensure it performs well on slow connections.

## **7\. Performance Metrics & Evaluation Framework**

To secure future funding, smalltalk.community must measure *outcomes* (reduction in loneliness), not just *outputs* (website hits).

### **7.1 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**

| KPI Category | Metric | Definition & Purpose | Target (Year 1\) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Impact** | **Loneliness Reduction** | Average change in user score on the *UCLA 3-Item Loneliness Scale*.17 | \>10% improvement |
| **Reach** | **Unique Regional Visitors** | Number of unique IPs from Murrindindi postcodes. | 500+ |
| **Engagement** | **Return Rate** | % of users who return to the site more than once a month. | \>20% |
| **Operational** | **Grant Success Rate** | % of grant applications that are successful. | \>50% |
| **Governance** | **Compliance Score** | Timely lodgement of ACNC/CAV statements. | 100% |

### **7.2 Evaluation Methodology**

* **The UCLA 3-Item Scale:** Integrate this short quiz into the annual user survey. It is scientifically valid and asks:  
  1. How often do you feel that you lack companionship?  
  2. How often do you feel left out?  
  3. How often do you feel isolated from others?  
* **Data Use:** This data allows you to tell a powerful story to funders: "Our users reported a 15% drop in feelings of isolation after 6 months."

## **8\. Partnership Framework and Volunteer Management**

### **8.1 Volunteer Management Framework**

* **Recruitment:** Do not recruit generally. Recruit for *specific tasks* (e.g. "Event Lister" \- 2 hours/month).  
* **Onboarding Pack:** Must include:  
  * Volunteer Code of Conduct (Signed).  
  * Privacy & Confidentiality Agreement (Signed).  
  * Working with Children Check (Sighted and recorded).  
* **Role Description:** Every volunteer gets a 1-page PD outlining duties, time commitment, and the person they report to.18

### **8.2 Partnership MOUs**

* **Template:** Create a standard Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for partners like Neighbourhood Houses.  
  * *Key Clauses:* Liability (who is responsible if an event goes wrong?), Data Ownership (who owns the sign-up list?), and Termination (30-day exit clause).  
* **Data Sharing:** Never share raw user data with partners. Share *insights* (e.g. "50 people from Yea searched for art classes") to help them plan, but keep the email addresses within smalltalk.community.

## **9\. Updated 2026 Operational Roadmap**

**Phase 1: Foundation & Safeguards (Jan – Mar)**

* **Jan:** Draft Risk Register & Privacy Policy. Establish "Core Hours."  
* **Feb:** Incorporate. ACNC Registration. Setup Banking (Two-to-sign).  
* **Mar:** Apply for Google Ad Grant. Tech build (Accessibility check).

**Phase 2: Content & Contingency (Apr – Jun)**

* **Apr:** Draft Volunteer Onboarding Pack.  
* **May:** Soft Launch. Test "Crisis Response" links.  
* **Jun:** **Mid-Year Review.** Evaluate "Founder Burnout" levels. If "Green," proceed.

**Phase 3: Engagement & Measurement (Jul – Sep)**

* **Jul:** Full Public Launch. Activate Google Ads.  
* **Aug:** **Founder Downtime.** Reduced capacity month. Focus on maintenance.  
* **Sep:** Collect first round of "Loneliness Scale" data via user poll.

**Phase 4: Review & Transition Planning (Oct – Dec)**

* **Oct:** AGM. Present Impact Report using KPIs.  
* **Nov:** Strategy session for 2027: Does the "Geographical Firewall" need to move?  
* **Dec:** Mandatory break.

## **10\. Post-2026 Transition Strategy**

The ultimate goal is to decouple the organisation from the founder’s full-time employment constraints.

* **Success Definition 2026:** A functional, compliant platform with 500+ active local users, $5k in seed funding, and a proven governance rhythm.  
* **The Bridge:**  
  * *Scenario A (Remain Full Time):* Continue the "Slow Burn" model. Appoint a volunteer "Operations Manager" to handle day-to-day.  
  * *Scenario B (Reduce to 0.6 FTE):* Founder takes on "Executive Director" role (unpaid) and expands operations into Mitchell Shire (lifting the firewall), as conflict can be managed via declared hours rather than total avoidance.  
* **Geographical Evolution:** Once the founder leaves Council or reduces hours significantly, the "Area of Benefit" can be expanded to include Mitchell Shire, using the data from Murrindindi as a "Pilot Study" to justify funding for the expansion.

This enhanced framework moves the organisation from a "passion project" to a robust, resilient entity capable of surviving the complexities of the Victorian non-profit sector.
