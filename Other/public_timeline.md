# smalltalk.community Public Timeline & Transparency Roadmap

**For Community Members | Updated January 2026**

This page shows exactly what we're building, when, and how your input shapes it.

---

## Why We Share This Timeline

We believe transparency builds trust, especially with community members who've been let down by organisations before.

You deserve to know:

- What we're building
- What we're NOT ready for yet
- How YOUR feedback shapes decisions
- When we're shifting from "listening" to "launching"

This is a living document. As things change, we'll update it and tell you why.

## CURRENT PHASE: MVP Development & Community Listening (January - February 2026)

### What's Happening Now

**Platform MVP Launch (This Month)**

We're launching a deliberately comprehensive platform that shows what smalltalk.community could become. It includes:

✓ Opportunity search and filtering (volunteer, music, learning, social, family, mentorship)
✓ User profiles for different community types
✓ Organisation portal for posting opportunities
✓ Personalised dashboards adapted for different ages
✓ Accessibility features (text scaling, high contrast, keyboard navigation)
✓ How-It-Works guides for 8 different community segments
✓ Feedback collection system
✓ Clear messaging that this is an MVP in development

### What's NOT in This MVP (We're Building Next)

❌ Complete safety frameworks (Working with Children Checks, incident reporting)
❌ Multilingual support (English only right now)
❌ Professional accessibility audit results (we're targeting WCAG 2.1 AA, not there yet)
❌ Mentorship matching algorithm (the buttons are ready, the matching logic comes later)
❌ Video tutorials (references as "coming soon")
❌ Full organisational verification beyond basic confirmation

**This doesn't mean we're ignoring these. It means we're doing them thoughtfully with community input, not rushing them.**

### Our Commitment to Your Feedback

**Every part of this platform will be shaped by real community members.**

Starting this month, we're recruiting:

- **Youth Advisory Board** (15-25 year-olds) — shaping features for young people
- **Seniors Reference Group** (65+) — ensuring it works for older adults
- **Cultural Advisory Group** (CALD & First Nations) — guiding cultural design
- **Disability Community Audit** — accessibility expertise
- **Organisation Partners Forum** — feedback from people delivering services

These aren't token consultations. Advisors are paid ($50/meeting), have real decision-making power, and their input directly shapes what we build in Phase 2.

### How to Get Involved Right Now

**[Join an Advisory Group]** → 3-month commitment, paid, flexible meetings

**[Share Your Feedback]** → 5-minute form, any feedback welcome

**[Sign Up for Updates]** → Monthly email showing what's changed

**[Attend a Feedback Session]** → We're coming to Kilmore, Seymour, Broadford in February

## PHASE 1: Community Co-Design & Foundation Building (February - March 2026)

### What We're Learning From You

During this phase, we're listening to community members use the MVP and asking:

- What's confusing?
- What's missing?
- Does this feel inclusive to you?
- Are there safety concerns?
- What would make this genuinely useful?

### What Changes Based on Your Input

Based on your feedback, we'll:

**February-March:**
- Update "How It Works" guides based on real user experience
- Fix confusing features
- Redesign navigation if people get lost
- Add features you're asking for (if they fit the vision)
- Identify accessibility issues that need fixing

### Advisory Groups Start Meeting

All advisory groups meet for the first time in February.

**Their First Task:**
- Use the MVP platform themselves
- Tell us what's broken, confusing, missing
- Help us understand how it feels for their community

**How This Works:**

1. You use the platform for 2-3 weeks
2. We come back together to discuss
3. We tell you exactly how your feedback is shaping changes
4. You help prioritise what to fix first

### Transparency: What We're Publishing

**Monthly Reports** (starting March):

- How many people are using the platform
- Feedback themes (what are people saying?)
- What we're changing based on feedback
- What's harder than we expected
- Safety concerns (if any) and how we're responding

---

## PHASE 2: Safety Frameworks & Accessibility Audit (April - June 2026)

### This Is Where We Build What Keeps People Safe

We're doing this AFTER getting community feedback (not before) because we want advisory groups shaping these decisions.

### Working with Children Check (WWC) Integration

**What This Is:** Victoria Police verification that adults working with young people are safe to do so

**Why It Matters:** Non-negotiable for protecting young people on the platform

**What Happens:**

1. Any organisation offering opportunities for under-18s must have WWC
2. Process is automated in the platform (no workarounds)
3. Advisory groups review the process to ensure it's not unfairly excluding people
4. Completed by end of April

### Organisational Verification (Beyond Basic Check)

**What This Is:** Making sure organisations are legitimate and trustworthy

**What Happens:**

1. Basic info confirmed (we already do this)
2. Reference checking (we ask previous organisations "Did this group run good programs?")
3. For high-risk activities, possible site visit
4. Clear code of conduct all organisations must follow
5. Completed by end of May

### Incident Reporting System

**What This Is:** If something goes wrong, there's a clear way to report it

**How It Works:**

1. Button on every page: "Report a Concern"
2. Reports go to our trained team (not public)
3. We review within 24 hours
4. We follow up with the person who reported
5. We take action (from gentle conversation to ending organisation's partnership)
6. We improve systems based on what we learn

**Advisory groups will help design this system** — they understand concerns specific to their communities.

### Professional Accessibility Audit

**What This Is:** An expert reviews the entire platform against WCAG 2.1 AA standards

**What Happens:**

1. Hire external auditor (April)
2. They test everything: screen readers, keyboard-only, colour contrast, cognitive load
3. They produce report identifying issues
4. We fix critical issues (MUST fix)
5. We fix high-priority issues (SHOULD fix)
6. We test with real disabled community members to verify fixes work

### First Nations Consultation

**This Happens Differently Than Other Consultation**

We're engaging through proper cultural protocols:

1. First Nations advisors lead this process (not us)
2. Proper compensation and timing
3. Review of content for cultural safety and respect
4. Design review from cultural perspective
5. We listen and implement recommendations

**Timeline:** April-May (not rushed)

### CALD Community Language & Cultural Features

**What We're Reviewing:**

- Which languages to support (based on Mitchell Shire community)
- Cultural features that matter to your community
- How to make the platform accessible if English isn't your first language

**Timeline:** May (after First Nations consultation)

### Transparency: What We're Publishing

**Quarterly Report** (July):

- Safety frameworks we've built
- What advisory groups recommended
- What we changed based on feedback
- What safety training organisations receive
- Accessibility audit results and remediation plan
- Next steps for launch preparation

---

## PHASE 3: Implementation & Soft Launch Prep (July - September 2026)

### We're Putting It All Together

Based on everything we've learned, we're:

1. Implementing Phase 2 changes into platform
2. Turning on all safety systems
3. Training organisations to use platform responsibly
4. Preparing community for launch

### Organisation Training Program

**Before organisations can post opportunities, they attend a 2-hour workshop.**

Topics:

- How to post opportunities safely
- What the code of conduct means
- How to work with volunteers
- Accessibility requirements
- How to report concerns
- Legal stuff (duty of care, privacy)

**When:** August (6 weeks before launch)

**Cost:** Free (provided by council)

**Attendance:** Mandatory

### Community Education Campaign

**Goal:** Help diverse community members know platform exists

**How:**

- Social media (Facebook, Instagram, TikTok)
- Local radio ads
- Posters in libraries, community centres, shops
- Stories in local news
- Email to council newsletter subscribers
- Council staff talking to community

**Messages:**

- "Your community. Connected."
- Different pathways for different people
- Free to use
- Safe and accessible
- Built with community input

**Timeline:** August-September (6 weeks before public launch)

### Soft Launch (September 2026)

**Who Gets Access First:**

1. Week 1: Council staff only (internal testing)
2. Week 2: Partner organisations + early community members
3. Week 3: Public announcement (anyone can join)

**What We Measure:**

- Is the platform working technically? (no major crashes)
- Can people actually use it? (is it intuitive?)
- Are we reaching diverse community? (or just young people again?)
- Do people feel safe? (any safety concerns?)
- Is it accessible? (in real-world use)

**What Can Go Wrong (And What We Do):**

- Critical bugs found → We pause signups, fix, resume
- Safety concern reported → Immediate investigation
- Specific group struggling → Pause, support, adjust
- Performance problems → Scale up or reduce features temporarily

---

## PHASE 4: Growth & Continuous Improvement (October 2026 onwards)

### Multilingual Support Rollout

**October-November:**

1. Identify 2-3 most-needed languages (from community feedback)
2. Hire professional translators
3. Translate core content + interface
4. Add language toggle to website
5. Support available in multiple languages

### Mentorship Features Expansion

**November onwards:**

- Build mentorship matching algorithm (smarter pairing)
- Create structured mentorship programs (6-month, with milestones)
- Training resources for mentors
- Public celebration of mentors

### Organisation Expansion

**Ongoing:**

- Actively recruit more partner organisations
- Training program for each new partner
- Expand to other types of organisations

### Planning Regional Expansion

**Late 2026 / Early 2027:**

- Document what works and what doesn't in Mitchell Shire
- Plan expansion to other regional Victorian communities
- Start conversations with other councils
- Begin open-sourcing process

## The Why Behind This Timeline

### Why Not Launch Publicly Right Now?

**We could. But we won't. Here's why:**

1. **Safety frameworks aren't ready** → We won't launch until we can protect vulnerable people
2. **We haven't heard from you yet** → You haven't had a chance to tell us what you need
3. **Accessibility audit isn't complete** → We're committing to WCAG standards; we need to verify we're there
4. **First Nations community needs proper consultation** → That takes time and respect, not rushing
5. **We'd launch to young people only again** → Without advisory group input, we'd repeat the mistake

A rushed launch builds the wrong thing. A thoughtful launch builds something community actually needs.

## How Your Feedback Shapes This Timeline

**Real Example:**

Suppose advisory group feedback says "the dashboard is too complex for seniors."

Here's what happens:

1. We hear this in February
2. We add to "things to improve" list
3. In April, we brainstorm with Seniors Reference Group
4. We redesign dashboard (simpler version)
5. We test with seniors in May
6. We refine based on testing
7. New design goes live in Phase 3
8. We report in July what changed and why

**Your feedback doesn't go into a black hole. It changes the actual product.**

## Questions?

### "Will this always be free?"

Yes. smalltalk.community will always be free for community members to use. We're exploring sustainable funding (grants, council support, social enterprise model) to keep it free.

### "Can I use it before September?"

Yes, the MVP is live now (January 2026). But know it's in development. If you find bugs or have feedback, tell us—that's helpful. If you'd prefer to wait until it's more complete, that's fine too.

### "What if something goes wrong while I'm using it?"

Email hello@smalltalk.community or call [phone]. We'll respond quickly. If it's a safety concern, we take it very seriously.

### "Will you actually listen to feedback, or is this consultation theatre?"

We're paying advisory group members ($50/meeting) because we value their time. We're publishing reports showing how feedback shaped decisions. We're delaying launch until safety frameworks are right. That's not theatre.

But you should verify this yourself. Ask us hard questions. If we're not listening, tell others.

### "What if you run out of money?"

That's a real risk. We're upfront about it. If we can't sustain the platform, we'll:

1. Tell community immediately
2. Not disappear quietly
3. Try to find sustainable funding or partner
4. Open-source the code so community can continue it

### "Can I see the code?"

Not yet. We're planning to open-source smalltalk.community in 2027. Until then, we're focused on building community trust and good practices.

### "How do I report a safety concern?"

Anywhere on the platform, you'll see a button: "Report a Concern." Or email hello@smalltalk.community. Or call [phone]. We review reports within 24 hours.

## Thank You

Building smalltalk.community is ambitious work. But it only matters if it actually serves the people we're trying to reach.

That's why we're doing this with you, not for you.

Thank you for being part of this.
