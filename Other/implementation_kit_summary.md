# smalltalk.community Implementation Kit

**Your Complete Package for Building the MVP**

---

## What You Now Have

You have three comprehensive documents that work together:

### 1. **smalltalk_ai_agent_prompt.md** (Production-Ready AI Prompt)

**What it is:** A detailed, context-rich prompt designed for Claude Opus 4.5 to generate the smalltalk.community MVP platform.

**What it includes:**

- Complete mission and context
- MVP scope definition (what IS and ISN'T included)
- Transparent messaging strategy
- Inclusive content and messaging framework
- All 8 "How It Works" guides (skeleton with detailed examples)
- Multi-dimensional opportunity tagging system (database schema + filtering UI)
- Adaptive dashboard implementation
- Navigation structure (desktop and mobile)
- Feedback collection system
- Timeline page component
- Technical requirements and stack
- Database schemas (ready to run)
- Code component examples (tsx)

**How to use it:**

1. Download the file
2. Add local details (phone numbers, addresses, council department names)
3. Share with your development team or Claude
4. Use as the single source of truth for MVP features
5. Update quarterly as you gather feedback

**Why it's valuable:**

- Eliminates ambiguity (developers know exactly what's expected)
- Includes real components, not just descriptions
- Incorporates community co-design framework from day one
- Transparent about limitations and next steps

---

### 3. **public_timeline.md** (Transparency Page for Community)

**What it is:** The content that will live on your `/timeline` page—transparent about what you're building and when.

**What it includes:**

- Why you're sharing this (builds trust)
- What's in MVP vs. what's coming

## Troubleshooting & Common Questions

### "Development is falling behind the timeline. What do I do?"

1. **Immediately:** Adjust timeline (better to be honest than miss deadlines)
2. **Identify bottleneck:** Is it code complexity? Understanding requirements? Missing resources?
3. **Decide:** Can you cut features (keep MVP focused)? Or do you need more development help?
4. **Communicate:** Tell council and community immediately (don't hide delays)
5. **Adjust:** Update public timeline, explain why

### "Advisory group member wants to change something fundamental."

1. **Listen fully** (don't dismiss)
2. **Understand why** (what problem are they solving?)
3. **Consider impact** (does this align with vision? Does it help other communities?)
4. **Decide together** (advisory group votes, or you explain why you're not doing it)
5. **Document decision** (so you remember why you chose this)

### "Safety concern discovered in MVP."

1. **Stop everything:** Pause new features
2. **Investigate:** What happened? How serious?
3. **Fix:** Implement safety fix
4. **Verify:** Test the fix thoroughly
5. **Communicate:** Tell affected users and council
6. **Learn:** What process failed? How prevent next time?
7. **Resume:** Start with safety fix validated

### "Council loses interest or funding."

1. **Report immediately:** Don't wait for scheduled updates
2. **Clarify path forward:** Can you continue with less funding? Different approach?
3. **Activate community:** Tell advisory groups, ask for support
4. **Find alternatives:** Grants, social enterprise funding, pro-bono help
5. **Honest conversation:** If not sustainable, say so and plan hand-off

### "First Nations community isn't responding to consultation."

This is often a sign you haven't engaged through proper protocols.

1. **Stop pushing:** Don't repeat approaches that aren't working
2. **Get guidance:** Work with Indigenous affairs expert on proper protocols
3. **Budget time:** This can't be rushed
4. **Budget funding:** Proper consultation requires payment
5. **Delay if needed:** Launch delay is better than disrespectful engagement

### "Accessibility audit reveals major issues."

1. **Don't panic:** This is normal. Audits find things.
2. **Prioritise:** Critical (must fix), High (should fix), Medium (nice to fix)
3. **Plan remediation:** Can you fix critical issues before launch?
4. **Delay launch if needed:** Launch incomplete accessibility is worse than delayed launch
5. **Communicate:** Tell community you're taking accessibility seriously (delay is sign of commitment)

## Template Responses to Common Feedback

### "This is too complicated for seniors."

**Don't Say:**

- "It's not that complicated, other seniors manage fine"
- "Seniors just need to use it more"

**Do Say:**

- "That's really valuable feedback. Can you show us specifically what's confusing?"
- "Let's design a simpler version and test it with you"
- "What would make this easier?"

### "Where do I find music opportunities?"

**Don't Say:**

- "Use the search filter for 'music'"

**Do Say:**

- "Great question. We know that's not obvious. Click 'Opportunities' → 'Music & Performance' (OR type 'music' in the search box at top)"
- "Still confusing? We're changing how search works in Phase 2 based on feedback like this"

### "I don't see anything for my cultural community."

**Don't Say:**

- "You're welcome to post opportunities yourself"
- "We'll add more partners later"

**Do Say:**

- "That's important feedback. We need more organisations from your community involved. Can we talk about how to reach them?"
- "We're working with a cultural advisory group on this. Would you like to be part of that conversation?"

### "Is my data safe?"

**Don't Say:**

- "We follow all privacy regulations"

**Do Say:**

- "Yes. Your data is encrypted, we never sell it, and you control who can see your profile. Here's our privacy policy [link]. Any specific concerns?"

## Final Checklist Before You Start

- [ ] You've read all three documents completely
- [ ] You understand what MVP includes and excludes
- [ ] You've talked to council leadership about timeline and budget
- [ ] You're committed to transparency (it matters)
- [ ] You're ready to listen to feedback (and change based on it)
- [ ] You've prepared for the possibility that "your" idea isn't what community needs
- [ ] You're okay with moving slower (right) than faster (wrong)
- [ ] You're excited to build this with community, not for them

If you can honestly check all of those boxes, you're ready to start.

## Let's Build Something Real

You've got the blueprint. You've got the timeline. You've got the commitment to transparency and community.

The hardest part now is doing the work. It's going to be challenging:

- Advisory groups will tell you hard truths
- First Nations consultation will move slower than you want
- Safety frameworks will delay launch
- You'll make mistakes and have to fix them
- Some community members will be skeptical (fair)
- Feedback will sometimes contradict itself
- You'll want to compromise, but some things aren't negotiable (safety)

But it's the only way to build something that actually works for a whole community.

Good luck, Ryan. Your community is lucky to have someone who cares this much.
