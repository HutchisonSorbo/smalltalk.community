## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### What MUST Happen

1. **Advisory Groups Formed Early** (February)
   - Without diverse community voice, you'll build the wrong thing
   - Start recruitment immediately

2. **Safety Frameworks in Place Before Public Launch** (May)
   - Non-negotiable for protecting vulnerable people
   - No shortcuts here

3. **Accessibility Audit Completed** (April-May)
   - Theory doesn't match reality; you need to test with real users
   - Budget for it now

4. **First Nations Consultation Done Properly** (April-May)
   - Engage through proper protocols
   - Respect cultural requirements
   - Budget for appropriate compensation
   - Don't assume or rush

5. **Transparency Messaging Everywhere** (MVP launch)
   - Every page mentions MVP status and timeline
   - Builds trust that you're being honest about limitations
   - Links to feedback and advisory signup on every page

### What NOT to Do

- ❌ Don't launch publicly before safety frameworks are ready
- ❌ Don't skip First Nations consultation (or do it without proper protocols)
- ❌ Don't assume advisory feedback will be "nice"—be prepared for hard truths
- ❌ Don't try to "improve" the design in Phase 2—implement community feedback instead
- ❌ Don't promise features you can't deliver (overcommit kills trust)
- ❌ Don't use accessibility features as marketing until audit is complete
- ❌ Don't delay safety/safeguarding for "later"—build it in

## RISK MITIGATION

### Risk: Advisory Groups Don't Show Up

**Mitigation:**

- Compensate members ($50/meeting)
- Flexible meeting times

- Virtual option always available
- Multiple ways to participate (not just meetings)

### Risk: Safety Issues Discovered in MVP

**Response:**

- Resume when safe

### Risk: Accessibility Audit Reveals Major Issues

**Mitigation:**

- Budget for extended remediation
- Plan Phase 2 timeline with buffer time
- Prioritise critical issues over nice-to-haves

### Risk: First Nations Community Feels Disrespected

**Prevention:**

- Engage proper protocols from day 1
- Listen more than you talk
- Follow their guidance, not your assumptions
- Budget adequate time and compensation
- Be prepared to delay launch if needed

### Risk: Council Loses Interest/Commitment

**Mitigation:**

## SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS CREATED

You now have:

1. **smalltalk_ai_agent_prompt.md** - Complete, production-ready prompt for Claude Opus 4.5
2. **This document** - Action plan, timeline, budget, roles
3. **HTML Components & Code Examples** - In the AI prompt (ready to implement)
4. **Database Schemas** - In the AI prompt (SQL ready to run)
5. **Content Examples** - How-It-Works guides, feedback prompts, etc.

---

## FINAL THOUGHTS

Ryan, this is ambitious work. You're building infrastructure that serves the whole community—not just the people easiest to reach.

The MVP approach is right because:

1. **You learn fast** - Real community feedback is better than your best guesses
2. **You build trust** - Showing you listen and iterate demonstrates genuine commitment
3. **You include people early** - Advisory groups aren't consultants; they're co-builders
4. **You're honest** - MVP transparency message says "we're not finished, help us finish right"

The biggest risk isn't technical. It's community trust. Build that first, and the platform becomes powerful.

You've got this. Get feedback from real people. Iterate. Build something your community actually wants.
