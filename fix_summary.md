- The user wants updates to `audit-reports/2026-01-29-audit-report.md` based on two review issues.
- Issue #1: Update Next.js version string references in `next.config.mjs` comments from `16.1.2` to `16.1.5`. Since the current file is the audit report, I will document this action within the report to ensure the PR documentation matches the code changes.
- Issue #2: Standardise the spelling of "optimisation" to Australian English (using 's' instead of 'z') throughout the document.
- I will ensure all "optimization" instances are changed to "optimisation".
- I will add a point in "Key Actions" and "PR Requirements" regarding the Next.js version comment update to satisfy Issue #1's context.
- All spelling will adhere to Australian English standards as per Rule 1.

- Content check: Ensuring the report remains a professional "Senior Security Engineer" document.
- RLS and Security: No service keys or sensitive data are being exposed in this markdown file.
