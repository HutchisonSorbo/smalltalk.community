# Exploit Detection Patterns (SCAN-2026-001)

Maintainers should search production logs (Vercel, Supabase, Axiom, etc.) for the following patterns to identify potential exploitation attempts related to CVE-2025-55182 (React) and CVE-2025-66478 (Next.js).

## 1. Malicious Headers

Search for requests containing these headers:

- `next-action`
- `rsc-action-id`

## 2. Payload Patterns

Search request bodies or logs for the following strings:

- `"status":"resolved_model"` (Indicates a resolved model payload in Flight protocol)
- `$@` (Specifically the `$@` sequence used to trigger the RCE/DoS)

## 3. Suspicious Activity

Look for:

- Unusual POST requests to server components/actions from unexpected IPs.
- Crashes or high CPU usage following requests with `next-action` headers (potential DoS via CVE-2025-55184).
- Source code contents appearing in logs (potential information leak via CVE-2025-55183).

## 4. Search Commands (Local/CLI)

If you have access to raw log files:

```bash
# Search for suspicious headers
grep -E "next-action|rsc-action-id" logs.txt

# Search for the malicious payload pattern
grep "\$@" logs.txt
```
